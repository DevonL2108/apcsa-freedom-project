# Entry 1: The Beginning and Brainstorming
##### 11/4/20

For my APCSA class, my teacher, Mr. Mueller, began introducing the class about what we will be learning this year and teaching Java through edhesive. During his introduction, he began talking about how people sometimes need some free time for their imagination to create a project they enjoy or are interested in. This year long project was called the Freedom Project.

Throughout the first few months of the school year, I was brainstorming ideas on what to do for my Freedom Project and what tools I would need for my project. I was thinking about creating a game, developing an IOS app that would benefit the community, or designing an informative website. Iâ€™m leaning towards using [Swift](https://www.swift.com/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to create an IOS application for people to find small jobs. Swift is a programming language created by Apple to give developers freedom to create an IOS app, and Firebase is a platform made by Google to help quickly develop high-quality apps and safely secures access to databases. Skills I learned from this were learning how to Google and communication skills. I learned how to Google by googling for information about my tools and how they are used to create an IOS application. I used my communication skills by talking with my peers and brainstorming ideas about topics we would like to do for our Freedom Project. I plan on doing this project with two of my peers, Ryan and Yuhong.

I am currently on the first step: Define the problem of the engineering design process and my next step is to start tinkering with Swift and Firebase.
